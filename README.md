We worked on an automated chess board that could move chess pieces on command. Our project employed an Arduino Uno with three stepper-motors to implement two-dimensional linear motion that propagated an electromagnet which moved chess pieces on voice command. A chess algorithm was programmed that worked in integration with the voice-recognition and speech-to-text code to move the right chess piece precisely to its desired destination. In a nutshell, our project is Wizardâ€™s Chess without the magic.
